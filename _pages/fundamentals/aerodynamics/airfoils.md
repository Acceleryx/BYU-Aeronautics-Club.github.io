Airfoil selection is one of the earliest and most important decisions made when desiging your UAV. The airfoil will play a large role in determining its aerodynamic performance characteristics and capabilities. As such, care should be taken to choose an airfoil that properly meets the performance requirements for your mission. Relevant requirements may relate to stability, lift and drag characteristics, and manufacturability. These and other important concepts will be discussed.

## Airfoil Geometry
To start, let's discuss the different parts of an airfoil. As you can see below, an airfoil typically has a thin, long profile. This provides large amounts of lift with minimal drag. The front (or forward most part) is called the leading edge, while the back (or aft most part) is called the trailing edge. If you were to draw a straight line from edge to edge, this would called the chord line and its length is the chord length (or just "chord").

### NACA Airfoils
The NACA four-digit series provides a convenient way to demonstrate some additional airfoil parameters. Each digit describes a different paramter of the airfoil. Let's use the NACA 4412 airfoil as an example. The first two digits describe the placement and
