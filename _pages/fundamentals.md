When designing a UAV, there is a lot you have to think about. From the very beginning of the design stage, a number of principles and concepts must be understood and applied in order to produce a feasible design. We have covered a number of foundational topics here to assist you as you design your UAV and prepare for prototyping and manufacturing. Many of these concepts have been drawn from Dr. Ning's textbook on Flight Vehicle Design for ME 415. If you would like to access the full text, you may do so [here](https://byu.box.com/v/me415book).
