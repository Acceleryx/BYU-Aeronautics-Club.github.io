[F3K](http://www.teamusaf3k.com/?page_id=44) is a class of remote controlled airplanes that are distinguished from other [F3 classes](https://www.fai.org/page/f3-radio-control-soaring) by being hand lanched. These gliders are often called [Discus Launched Gliders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discus_Launch_Glider). This pathway is aerodyanmic efficiency and wing design focused, but has an optinal deviation into propulsion. It also includes necessary auxiliaries for full plane design, but is focused on lightweight, efficient gliders.

Currently, only the bare-bones framework has been outlined, so a few trailblazers are needed to begin putting together all the information projected to be included in this pathway. Raw information and some tutorials have been gathered by club members and are available from the club leadership.
