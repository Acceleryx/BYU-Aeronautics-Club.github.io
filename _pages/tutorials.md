In the Aeronautics Club, we believe that engineering is beyond what you see in a classroom setting. The classroom is an excellent place to learn principles, discuss theory, and build a good foundation of engineering knowledge. We supplement that with a wide breadth of practical skills that help students to be successful in hands-on engineering projects. We have prepared tutorials of some key processes to help you get started on some new skills. Click any of the links to get started!
