The BYU Aeronautics Club is the only club on campus dedicated to the design, construction, and flight of fixed-wing UAV's. We started in 2018 as a small offshoot from the BYU branch of the AIAA (American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics). Dedicated leadership and club members helped to build this club into a community of students commited to engineering excellence. We welcome students from any major or background, giving you the tools and knowledge you need to be successful in the field of aeronautics and have fun along the way.
